The following directory is really just a utility directory for exporting and importing environment variables.  
There is also a SpotDefaults for reference.  There is an empty set of environment variables, these need values for Spotter to work
properly.  I may build in some logic to the menu to make them disappear if the API keys are not populated for instance,but as of now they'll just dump.
