1] Install Virtualenv to create a container for this python environment

2] check what version of python you have installed:
    python2 --version
    python3 --version
    
3] create a install folder directory to become the container directory in this example
    mkdir ~/OTP
    
4] create the python scripts containerized env, in this case python 3.73 was installed.
    virtualenv â€“-python=python3.7 ~/OTP
    
5] create a subfolder under OTP called "SpotData" ; there is where the JSON will be written

cd ~/OTP
mkdir SpotData
cd ~/OTP
copy the Spot_OTP.py script at root of OTP directory where the script will be run

6] change directories to enable the container
cd ~/OTP/bin
source activate
Once complete you should now see (OTP) meaning the container is active.

7] from the OTP directory type the following to run the script

python Spot_OTP.py

check the SpotData folder to see the Json written.

8] to improve the randomization I would recommend running on the RaspberryPi and add a Hardware random number seed.  I use Open RNG
